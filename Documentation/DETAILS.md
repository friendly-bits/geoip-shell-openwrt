## **Prelude**
- geoip-shell supports a numer of different use cases, many different platforms, and 2 backend firewall utilities (nftables and iptables). For this reason I designed it to be modular rather than monolithic. In this design, the functionality is split between few main scripts. Each main script performs specific tasks and utilizes library scripts which are required for the task with the given platform and firewall utility.
- This document intends to provide some info on the purpose and core options of the main scripts and how they work in tandem.
- The main scripts display "usage" when called with the "-h" option. You can find out about some additional options specific to each script by running it with that option.

## **Overview**

### Main Scripts
- geoip-shell-install.sh
- geoip-shell-uninstall.sh
- geoip-shell-manage.sh
- geoip-shell-run.sh
- geoip-shell-fetch.sh
- geoip-shell-apply.sh
- geoip-shell-backup.sh
- geoip-shell-cronsetup.sh

### Helper Scripts
- geoip-shell-geoinit.sh

  This script is sourced from all main scripts. It sets some essential variables, checks for compatible shell, then sources the -lib-common script, then sources the /etc/geoip-shell/geoip-shell.const file which stores some system-specific constants.

- geoip-shell-detect-lan.sh

This script is only used under specific conditions:
- During initial setup, with whitelist mode, and only if wan interfaces were set to 'all', and lan subnets were not specified via command line args. geoip-shell then assumes that it is being installed on a machine belonging to a LAN, uses this script to detect the LAN subnets and offers the user to add them to the whitelist, and to enable automatic detection of LAN subnets in the future.
- At the time of creating/updating firewall rules, and only if LAN subnets automatic detection was enabled during initial setup or later via the `geoip-shell configure -l auto` command. The suite then re-detects and refreshes the LAN subnets in the whitelist automatically.

### Library Scripts
- lib/geoip-shell-lib-common.sh
- lib/geoip-shell-lib-setup.sh
- lib/geoip-shell-lib-ipt.sh
- lib/geoip-shell-lib-nft.sh
- lib/geoip-shell-lib-status.sh
- lib/geoip-shell-lib-check-compat.sh
- lib/geoip-shell-lib-arrays.sh
- lib/geoip-shell-lib-uninstall.sh

- The 'library' term is used loosely as some of these scripts actually do some work by themselves. What's common to all of them is that they are sourced from other scripts rather than called to run as an individual script.
- The -lib-common script includes a large number of functions used throughout the suite, and assigns some essential variables.
- The lib-setup script implements CLI interactive and noninteractive setup and arguments parsing. It is used in the -install and -manage scripts.
- The -lib-status script implements the status report which you can get by issuing the `geoip-shell status` command.
- The -ipt and -nft scripts implement support for iptables and nftables, respectively. They are sourced from other scripts which need to interact with the firewall utility directly.
- The -lib-check-compat script checks for some essential dependencies
- The -lib-arrays script implements a minimal subset of functions emulating the functionality of associative arrays in POSIX-compliant shell. It is used in the -fetch script. It is a part of a larger project implementing much more of the arrays functionality. You can check my other repositories if you are interested.
- The -lib-uninstall script has some functions which are used both for uninstallation and for reset if required.

### OpenWrt-specific scripts
These are only installed on OpenWrt systems. The .tpl files are "templates" which are used to create the final scripts at the time of installation (when using the install script), or at the time of OpenWrt package preparation.
- geoip-shell-lib-owrt-common.sh
- geoip-shell-owrt-init.tpl
- geoip-shell-owrt-mk-fw-include.tpl
- geoip-shell-owrt-fw-include.tpl
- geoip-shell-owrt-uninstall.sh (only installed via an ipk package)
- mk-owrt-package.sh

### Optional script
- check-ip-in-source.sh
  This script is intended for checks before installation. It does not get installed.

### User interface
The scripts intended as user interface are **geoip-shell-install.sh**, **geoip-shell-uninstall.sh**, **geoip-shell-manage.sh** and **check-ip-in-source.sh**. All the other scripts are intended as a back-end. If you just want to install and move on, you only need to run the -install script.
After installation, the user interface is provided by running "geoip-shell", which is a symlink to the -manage script.

## **Main scripts in detail**
**geoip-shell-install.sh**
- Processes command line arguments, then, if needed, asks the user additional questions.
- Creates directories for config and data.
- Sets permissions for the data and config directories to be only readable and writable by root.
- Copies the scripts to `/usr/bin`, config to `/etc/geoip-shell`, and creates a directory for data in `/var/lib/geoip-shell` (or in `/etc/geoip-shell/data` on OpenWrt).
- Sets the initial config.
- Calls the -manage script to set up geoip (which, in turn, calls additional scripts).
- If an error occurs during the installation, it is propagated back through the execution chain and eventually the -install script calls the -uninstall script to revert any changes made to the system.
- Installation is possible either fully interactively (no command line arguments required), partially interactively (you provide some command line arguments, the install script processes them and if needed, asks you additional questions), or completely non-interactively by calling the install script with the `-z` option which will force installation failure if any required options are missing or invalid.
- The -install script does not install itself into the system.

Options:
- `-m <whitelist|blacklist>`: geoip blocking mode
- `-c <"[country_codes]">`: country codes to include in the whitelist or blacklist
- `-u <ripe|ipdeny>`: specify source to fetch the ip lists from. Currently supports 'ripe' and 'ipdeny'. Defaults to ipdeny for OpenWrt, to ripe for all other systems.
- `-i <"[ifaces]"|auto|all>`: specify whether firewall rules will be applied to specific network interface(s), to autodetected WAN interfaces or to all network interfaces.
- `-l <"[lan_ips]"|auto|none>`: when installing in whitelist mode and for all network interfaces, specify LAN ip addresses or subnets to exclude from blocking, otherwise they will get blocked. `auto` will automatically detect LAN subnets at the time of installation and then later, each time when updating firewall rules and ip sets. If the machine has dedicated WAN interfaces, `auto` may misdetect the WAN subnet as LAN subnet. So don't use `auto` in this situation. The `-l` option is incompatible with blacklist mode (and the install script will not allow this combination).
- `-t <"[trusted_ips]">` : optional list of trusted ip addresses or subnets anywhere on the Internet to exclude from geoip blocking.
- `-r <[user_country_code]|none>`: Specify user's country code. Used to prevent accidental lockout of a remote machine. `none` disables this feature.
- `-f <ipv4|ipv6|"ipv4 ipv6">`: specify the ip protocol family (ipv4 or ipv6). Defaults to both.
- `-p <tcp|udp>:<allow|block>:<all|[ports]>`: specify ports geoip blocking will apply (or not apply) to, for tcp or udp. To specify ports for both protocols, use the `-p` option twice in one command. For more details, read [NOTES.md](/Documentation/NOTES.md), sections 8-10.
- `-s <"[schedule_expression]"|disable>`: specify custom cron schedule expression for the autoupdate schedule. Default cron schedule is "15 4 * * *" - at 4:15 [am] every day, or "15 4 * * 5" for OpenWrt - each Friday at 4:15am. 'disable' instead of the schedule will disable autoupdates.
- `-n <true|false>`: NoPersistence. `true` disables persistence (reboot cron job won't be created so after system reboot, there will be no more geoip blocking - unless the autoupdate cron job kicks in). `false` enables persistence. Default is `false`.
- `-o <true|false>`: Nobackup. `true` disables automatic backups of the ip sets and geoip config, `false` enables them. Backups are used both as a backup, and for persistence since ip lists are loaded from the backup at reboot. Installation with this option will avoid using permanent storage for the ip lists but will trigger ip lists re-fetch at reboot. This option is only useful for devices with very small storage size (backup of a dozen large ip lists takes around 0.5MB). Default is `true` for OpenWrt systems, `false` for all other systems.
- `a <path>`: Data directory path. The data directory stores the backup and the status file. Defaults to `/tmp/geoip-shell-data` for OpenWrt, `/var/lib/geoip-shell` for other systems.
- `-w <ipt|nft>`: specify the backend firewall management utility to use with geoip-shell. `ipt` for iptables, `nft` for nftables. Default is nftables if it is present in the system
- `-N <true|false>`: NoBlock. If installing with the `-N true` option, the geoip 'enable' rule will not be created. This can be used if you want to install and check the rules before commiting to actual geoip blocking. To enable blocking later, use the command `geoip-shell on`, or reinstall with the `-N false` option. Default is `false`.
- `-O <memory|performance>`: create nftables sets with given optimization policy. By default, optimizes for memory when the machine has less than 2GiB RAM, otherwise optimizes for performance.

**geoip-shell-uninstall.sh**
- Removes geoip firewall rules, geoip cron jobs, scripts' data and config, and deletes the scripts from /usr/bin

Advanced options:
- `-r`: prepares the system for re-installation of geoip-shell: cleans up previous firewall geoip rules, removes backups and removes the cron jobs (and the OpenWrt-specific scripts).

**geoip-shell-manage.sh**: serves as the main user interface to configure geoip after installation. You can also call it by simply typing `geoip-shell`. As most scripts in this suite, it requires root privileges because it needs to interact with the netfilter kernel component and access the data folder which is only readable and writable by root. Since it serves as the main user interface, it contains a lot of logic to generate a report, parse, validate and initiate actions requested by the user (by calling other scripts as required), check for possible remote machine lockout and warn the user about it, check actions result, update the config and take corrective actions in case of an error. Describing all this is beyond the scope of this document but you can read the code. Sources the lib-status script when generating a status report. Sources lib-setup for some of the arguments parsing logic and interactive dialogs implementation.

`geoip-shell <on|off> [-c <"country_codes">]` : Enable or disable the geoip blocking chain (via a rule in the base geoip chain)

`geoip-shell <add|remove> [-c <"country_codes">]` :
* Adds or removes the specified country codes to/from the config file.
* Calls the -run script to fetch the ip lists for specified countries and apply them to the firewall (or to remove them).

`geoip-shell status`
* Displays information on the current state of geoip blocking
* For a list of all firewall rules in the geoip chain, run `geoip-shell status -v`.

`geoip-shell restore` : re-fetches and re-applies geoip firewall rules and ip lists as per the config.

**Options for the `geoip-shell configure` command:**

`-m [whitelist|blacklist]`: Change geoip blocking mode.

`-c <"country codes">`: Change which country codes are included in the whitelist/blacklist (this command replaces all country codes with newly specified ones).

`-f <ipv4|ipv6|"ipv4 ipv6">`: Families (defaults to 'ipv4 ipv6'). Use double quotes for multiple families.

`-u [ripe|ipdeny]`: Change ip lists source.

`-i <[ifaces]|auto|all>`: Change which network interfaces geoip firewall rules are applied to. `auto` will attempt to automatically detect WAN network interfaces. `auto` works correctly in **most** cases but not in **every** case. Don't use `auto` if the machine has no direct connection to WAN. The automatic detection occurs only when manually triggered by the user via this command.

`-l <"[lan_ips]"|auto|none>`: Specify LAN ip's or subnets to exclude from blocking (both ipv4 and ipv6). `auto` will trigger LAN subnets re-detection at every update of the ip lists. When specifying custom ip's or subnets, automatic detection is disabled. This option is only avaiable when using geoip-shell in whitelist mode.

`-t <"[trusted_ips]|none">`: Specify trusted ip's or subnets (anywhere on the Internet) to exclude from geoip blocking (both ipv4 and ipv6).

`-p <[tcp|udp]:[allow|block]:[all|<ports>]>`: specify ports geoip blocking will apply (or not apply) to, for tcp or udp. To specify ports for both tcp and udp, use the `-p` option twice. For more details, read [NOTES.md](/Documentation/NOTES.md), sections 9-11.

`-r <[user_country_code]|none>` : Specify user's country code. Used to prevent accidental lockout of a remote machine. `none` disables this feature.

`-s <"schedule_expression"|disable>` : enables automatic ip lists updates and configures the schedule for the periodic cron job which implements this feature. `disable` disables automatic ip lists updates.

`-o <true|false>` : No backup. If set to 'true', geoip-shell will not create a backup of ip lists and firewall rules after applying changes, and will automatically re-fetch ip lists after each reboot. Default is 'true' for OpenWrt, 'false' for all other systems.

`-a <path>` : Set custom path to directory where backups and the status file will be stored. Default is '/tmp/geoip-shell-data' for OpenWrt, '/var/lib/geoip-shell' for all other systems.

`-w <ipt|nft>`: specify the backend firewall management utility to use with geoip-shell. `ipt` for iptables, `nft` for nftables. Default is nftables if it is present in the system.

`-O <memory|performance>`: specify optimization policy for nftables sets. By default optimizes for low memory consumption if system RAM is less than 2GiB, otherwise optimizes for performance. This option doesn't work with iptables.

`geoip-shell showconfig` : prints the contents of the config file.


**geoip-shell-run.sh**: Serves as a proxy to call the -fetch, -apply and -backup scripts with arguments required for each action. Executes the requested actions, depending on the config set by the -install and -manage scripts, and the command line options, and writes to system log when starting and on action completion (or if any errors encountered). If persistence or autoupdates are enabled, the cron jobs (or on OpenWrt, the firewall include script) call this script with the necessary options. If a non-fatal error is encountered during an automatic update function, the script enters sort of a temporary daemon mode where it will re-try the action (up to a certain number of retries) with increasing time intervals. It also implements some logic to account for unexpected issues encountered during the 'restore' action which runs after system reboot to impelement persistnece, such as a missing backup, and in this situation will automatically change its action from 'restore' to 'update' and try to re-fetch and re-apply the ip lists.

`geoip-shell-run add -l <"list_id [list_id] ... [list_id]">` : Fetches ip lists, loads them into ip sets and applies firewall rules for specified list id's.
A list id has the format of `<country_code>_<family>`. For example, ****US_ipv4** and **GB_ipv6** are valid list id's.

`geoip-shell-run remove -l <"list_ids">` : Removes iplists and firewall rules for specified list id's.

`geoip-shell-run update` : Updates the ip sets for list id's that had been previously configured. Intended for triggering from periodic cron jobs.

`geoip-shell-run restore` : Restore previously downloaded lists from backup (skip fetching). Used by the reboot cron job (or by the firewall include on OpenWrt) to implement persistence.

**geoip-shell-fetch.sh**
- Fetches ip lists for given list id's from RIPE or from ipdeny. The source is selected during installation. If you want to change the default which is RIPE, install with the `-u ipdeny` option.
- Parses, validates, compiles the downloaded lists, and saves each one to a separate file.
- Implements extensive sanity checks at each stage (fetching, parsing, validating and saving) and handles errors if they occur.

(for specifics on how to use the script, run it with the -h option)

**geoip-shell-apply.sh**:  directly interfaces with the firewall. Creates or removes ip sets and firewall rules for specified list id's. Sources the lib-apply-ipt or lib-apply-nft script which does most of the actual work.

`geoip-shell-apply add -l <"list_ids">` :
- Loads ip list files for specified list id's into ip sets and applies firewall rules required for geoip blocking.

List id has the format of `<country_code>_<family>`. For example, **US_ipv4** and **GB_ipv6** are valid list id's.

`geoip-shell-apply remove -l <"list_ids">` :
- removes ip sets and geoip firewall rules for specified list id's.

**geoip-shell-cronsetup.sh** manages all the cron-related logic and actions. Called by the -manage script. Cron jobs are created based on the settings stored in the config file. Also used to validate cron schedule provided by the user at the time of installation or later.

**geoip-shell-backup.sh**: Creates a backup of current geoip-shell firewall rules and ip sets and current geoip-shell config, or restores them from backup. By default (if you didn't run the installation with the '-o' option), backup will be created after every change to ip sets in the firewall. Backups are automatically compressed and de-compressed with the best utility available to the system, in this order "bzip2, xz, gzip", or simply "cat" as a fallback if neither is available (which generally should never happen on Linux). Only one backup copy is kept. Sources the lib-backup-ipt or the lib-backup-nft script which does most of the actual work.

`geoip-shell-backup create-backup` : Creates a backup of the current firewall state and geoip blocking config.

`geoip-shell-backup restore` : Restores the firewall state and the config from backup. Used by the *run script to implement persistence. Can be manually used for recovery from fault conditions.

## **Optional script**
**check-ip-in-source.sh** can be used to verify that a certain ip address belongs to a subnet found in source records for a given country. It is intended for manual use and is not called from other scripts. It requires the grepcidr utility to be installed in your system.

`sh check-ip-in-source.sh -c <country_code> -i <"ip [ip] [ip] ... [ip]"> [-u <source>]`

- Supported sources are 'ripe' and 'ipdeny'.
- Any combination of ipv4 and ipv6 addresses is supported.
- If passing multiple ip addresses, use double quotes around them.
